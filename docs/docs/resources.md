# Resources[^starbeam]


> **Key Point** <br>
> A resource is a reactive function with cleanup logic.

Resources are created with an owner, and whenever the owner is cleaned up, the resource is also cleaned up. This is called ownership linking.

Typically, a component in your framework will own your resources. The framework renderer will make sure that when your component is unmounted, its associated resources are cleaned up.

<summary>Resources Convert Processes Into Values</summary>

Typically, a resource converts an imperative, stateful process, such as an asynchronous request or a ticking timer, into a reactive value.

That allows you to work with a process just like you'd work with any other reactive value.

This is a very powerful capability, because it means that adding cleanup logic to an existing reactive value doesn't change the code that works with the value.

The only thing that changes when you convert a reactive value into a resource is that it must be instantiated with an owner. The owner defines the resource's lifetime. Once you've instantiated a resource, the value behaves like any other reactive value.

## A Very Simple Resource[^starbeam-simple-resource]

To illustrate the concept, let's create a simple resource that represents the current time.

```js 
import { cell, resource } from "ember-resources";
 
export const Now = resource(({ on }) => {
  const now = cell(Date.now());
 
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    now.set(Date.now());
  });
 
  on.cleanup(() => {
    clearInterval(timer);
  });
 
  return () => now.current;
});
```

> **ðŸ’¡**
> A resource's return value is a reactive value. If your resource represents a single cell, it's fine to return it directly. It's also common to return a function which returns reactive data -- that depends on reactive state that you created inside the resource constructor.
